# PowerShell-GetInventory
A PowerShell module for creating an inventory of Windows hardware and software

Main use is to enumerate registry hives of offline Windows installations from something like Windows PE or another copy of Windows to gather a list of installed software, to gather a list of hardware information, and to export the information to HTML/CSV.

This module hasn't been looked at for a while so treat as entirely untested
